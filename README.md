Food waste is a major issue in our current system, with an estimated 1.3 billion tons of food wasted globally every year. Meal-Connect is a non-profit organization dedicated to addressing this problem by connecting NGOs and charities with surplus food from hotels, restaurants, and family functions.

Our mission is to utilize surplus food from hotels and distribute it to underprivileged individuals, ensuring that no meal goes to waste. We aim to fight against hunger and make a significant impact in the lives of those in need.

## How It Works

- **Central Hub:** Meal-Connect serves as a central hub where hotels can easily upload information about their surplus food.
- **Detailed Information:** Hotels provide detailed descriptions and quantities of the available food.
- **Efficient Planning:** This information helps NGOs efficiently plan and distribute meals to those in need.
- **Minimize Waste:** By streamlining the process, we minimize waste and maximize resource utilization.
- **Quick Response:** Our platform facilitates a quick and effective response to hunger-related issues.
